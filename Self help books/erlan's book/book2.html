            <p>by Stephen R. Covey</p>
            <hr class="line2">
            <br>
            When Stephen Covey first released The Seven Habits of 
			Highly Effective People, the book became an instant rage because people
			suddenly got up and took notice that their lives were 
			headed off in the wrong direction; and more than that, 
			they realized that there were so many simple things they could do 
			in order to navigate their life correctly. This book was wonderful education for people,
			education in how to live life effectively and get closer to the ideal of being a ‘success’ in life.<br><br>
            
			
			There are two major issues here,
			and we're just talking about people who have already read the novel. 
			The first issue is that most people are too lazy to put Stephen Covey's ideals 
			into practice. The second issue is that many people have a limited understanding 
			of Covey's values. There are people who have already been wowed by the novel.
			That's what we're aiming for. We're attempting to demonstrate 
			how Covey's novel, or more accurately, his model, was a complete model in and 
			of itself. There was nothing wrong with it. There should be no part of your life 
			left unnoticed if you put it into action. The only requirement is that you comprehend
			these concepts and attempt to put them into practice throughout your life.
