            <h2 style="font-size: 32px;">Best Self: Be You, Only Better</h2>
            <p>by Mike Bayer</p>
            <hr class="line2">
            <br>
            Mike Bayer, known to the thousands of clients whose lives he has changed as Coach Mike, has helped 
			everyone from pop stars to business executives to people just like you discover the freedom to be 
			their best selves. By asking them and leading them to ask themselves a series of important but 
			tough questions—such as “What are your core values?”  “Do you go to bed each day more knowledgeable
			than when you woke up?” and “Am I neglecting some aspect of my physical health out of fear or denial?”—he 
			helps them see what their Best Selves and Anti-Selves really look like. As a mental health specialist, 
			a personal development coach, and an all-around change agent, Mike has seen the amazing ways in which 
			lives can improve with honesty and clarity.  He understands our struggles intimately, because he’s 
			faced—and overcome—his own. And he knows that change is possible.<br><br>
            By working through each of the Seven SPHERES of life—Social, Personal, Health, Education, Relationships, 
			Employment and Spiritual Development—Best Self is an accessible and interactive book that distills all 
			of Coach Mike’s wisdom into a compact, focused guide that will ignite anyone’s desire for change. Chock 
			full of revealing quizzes, and full of provocative questionnaires, Best Self will empower you to embrace 
			your authenticity, acknowledge what is holding you back, and break through to live a passionate life to 
			the fullest, forever.
