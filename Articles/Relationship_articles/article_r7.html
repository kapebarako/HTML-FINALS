        <h4>Our guide to reflecting on the relationships in your life and opening yourself up to 
		the opportunity for love to grow.</h4>
        You don’t have to wait for Valentine’s day to pause and reflect on the relationships 
		you value in your life. Whether it be with colleagues, friends, lovers, or a spouse, 
		you can always benefit from taking a step back, appreciating the love you have in your 
		life and making the time to show others you care about them.
		When you are mindful of the love in your life you open yourself up to the opportunity for 
		love to grow. And not just romantic love, but self-love, and loving friendships as well.

			<h5>The Benefits of Healthy Relationships</h5>
            Louis Cozolino, professor of psychology at Pepperdine University, 
			is deeply engaged with another idea. In Cozolino’s book, Timeless: 
			Nature’s Formula for Health and Longevity, he emphasizes the positive 
			impact of human relationships.feel. <br>
			“Of all the experiences we need to survive and thrive, it is the 
			experience of relating to others that is the most meaningful and 
			important,” he writes.<br>
			Since the publication of Cozolino’s earlier book, The Neuroscience 
			of Human Relationships, the field of social neuroscience has expanded
			tremendously. We now know that people who have more social support tend
			to have better mental health, cardiovascular health, immunological functioning,
			and cognitive performance. <br><br>

    <div class="center" style="text-align:justify; margin:0 50px;">
        <p>Research backs this up, suggesting that positive relationships can help us succeed, 
		grow, and become better people. Romantic partners often encourage and support one another 
		toward shared goals. When parents are highly involved in school, their children tend to do 
		well academically. And positive support from friends, especially during adolescence and 
		early adulthood, can encourage us to be more empathic and helpful toward others.</p>
		<h5><strong>1. Start with kindness</strong></h5>
		<p>Kindness is like a magnet. People like to be around others who are kind because they 
		feel cared about and safe with them. The Golden Rule, “Do unto others as you would want 
		them to do to you” still rings true today.</p>
		<h5><strong>2. Let go of toxic people</strong></h5>
		<p>Take an inventory of your relationships to get a sense of who’s nourishing you and 
		who’s depleting you. A strong relationship will make you feel comfortable, confident, 
		and fully supported.</p>
		<h5><strong>3. Focus on similarities, not differences</strong></h5>
		<p>If you want to foster a greater sense of connection in your life, it’s helpful to 
		think of what we share as human beings—even with the people you might not always 
		see eye to eye on.</p>

        <div class="left"><img src="../IMAGES/R/r7_2.jpg" width="500px" style="margin:0 20px;"></div>
        <p>Having strong relationships is one of the single greatest predictors of wellness, happiness, and longevity. 
		And our connections flourish when we take time to get to know ourselves, and others, better.</p>
