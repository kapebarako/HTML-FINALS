        <h4>Strong, healthy relationships are important throughout your life.</h4>
        Your social ties with family members, friends, neighbors, coworkers, and others impact 
		your mental, emotional, and even physical well-being.
        “We can’t underestimate the power of a relationship in helping to promote well-being,” 
		says NIH psychologist and relationship expert Dr. Valerie Maholmes. Studies have found 
		that having a variety of social relationships may help reduce stress and heart-related 
		risks. Strong social ties are even linked to a longer life. On the other hand, loneliness 
		and social isolation are linked to poorer health, depression, and increased risk of early death.

			<h5><strong>What Is Healthy?</strong></h5>
            Every relationship exists on a spectrum from healthy to unhealthy to abusive. 
			One sign of a healthy relationship is feeling good about yourself 
			around your partner, family member, or friend. You feel safe talking 
			about how you feel. You listen to each other. You feel valued, and you
			trust each other. <br>
			In an unhealthy or abusive relationship, your partner may blame you for feeling 
			bad about something they did or said. They may tell you that you’re too sensitive. 
			Putting you down diminishes you and keeps them in control.<br>
			In a healthy relationship, however, if you tell your partner that something they said 
			hurt your feelings, they feel bad for hurting you. They try not to do it again.<br><br>

        <h5><strong>Social Ties Protect</strong></h5>   
        <p>Studies have shown that certain factors seem to protect people from forming unhealthy relationships 
          over their lifetime. The protection starts early in life. NIH-supported research has shown that the 
          quality of an infant’s emotional bond with a parent can have long-lasting positive or negative effects 
          on the ability to develop healthy relationships.

    <div class="left"><img src="../IMAGES/R/r6_2.jpg" width="400px"></div>
    <div style="float: right; width: 61%; margin-right: 40px;">
        <p>“The early bond has implications that go well beyond the first years of life,” says Dr. Grazyna Kochanska, 
		an NIH-funded family relationships researcher at the University of Iowa. The goal of Kochanska’s research projects
		is to understand the long-term effects of that early bond and to help children develop along positive pathways and 
		avoid paths toward antisocial behaviors.</p>
        <p>A family that functions well is central to a child’s development. Parents can help children learn how to listen, 
		set appropriate boundaries, and resolve conflicts. Parents teach children by example how to consider other people’s 
		feelings and act in ways to benefit others.</p>
		<p>Secure emotional bonds help children and teens develop trust and self-esteem. They can then venture out of the 
		family to form other social connections, like healthy friendships. In turn, healthy friendships reduce the risk of 
		a child becoming emotionally distressed or engaging in antisocial behaviors.</p>
