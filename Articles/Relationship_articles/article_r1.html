        <h4>Social relationships—both quantity and quality—affect mental health, health behavior, 
            physical health, and mortality risk.</h4>
            Sociologists have played a central role in establishing the link between social relationships and health outcomes, 
            identifying explanations for this link, and discovering social variation (e.g., by gender and race) at the population 
            level. Studies show that social relationships have short- and long-term effects on health, for better and for worse, and 
            that these effects emerge in childhood and cascade throughout life to foster cumulative advantage or disadvantage in health.

                <h1>"</h1><h5>Studies consistently show that individuals with the lowest level of involvement in social relationships 
                    are more likely to die than those with greater involvement</h5><h1>"</h1>

        <div class="two">
            Many types of scientific evidence show that involvement in social relationships benefits health. The most striking 
            evidence comes from prospective studies of mortality across industrialized nations. These studies consistently show that 
            individuals with the lowest level of involvement in social relationships are more likely to die than those with greater involvement. 
            For example, Berkman and Syme (1979) showed that the risk of death among men and women with the fewest social ties was more than 
            twice as high as the risk for adults with the most social ties. Moreover, this finding held even when socioeconomic status, health 
            behaviors, and other variables that might influence mortality, were taken into account. Social ties also reduce mortality risk among 
            adults with documented medical conditions. For instance, Brummett and colleagues (2001) found that, among adults with coronary artery disease, 
            the socially isolated had a risk of subsequent cardiac death 2.4 times greater than their more socially connected peers.

    <div class="center" style="text-align:justify; margin:0 50px;">
        In addition to mortality, involvement in social relationships has been associated with specific health conditions as well as biological markers 
        indicating risk of preclinical conditions. Several recent review articles provide consistent and compelling evidence linking a low quantity or 
        quality of social ties with a host of conditions, including development and progression of cardiovascular disease, recurrent myocardial infarction, 
        atherosclerosis, autonomic dysregulation, high blood pressure, cancer and delayed cancer recovery, and slower wound healing 
        (Ertel, Glymour, and Berkman 2009; Everson-Rose and Lewis 2005; Robles and Kiecolt-Glaser 2003; Uchino 2006). Poor quality and low quantity of social 
        ties have also been associated with inflammatory biomarkers and impaired immune function, factors associated with adverse health outcomes and mortality 
        (Kiecolt-Glaser et al. 2002; Robles and Kiecolt-Glaser 2003). Marriage is perhaps the most studied social tie. Recent work shows that marital history 
        over the life course shapes a range of health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, chronic conditions, mobility limitations, self-rated health, 
        and depressive symptoms (Hughes and Waite 2009; Zhang and Hayward 2006).
