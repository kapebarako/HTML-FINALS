        <h4>When it comes to relationships, most of us are winging it. 
		We’re exhilarated by the early stages of love, but as we move onto the general 
		grind of everyday life, personal baggage starts to creep in and we can find ourselves
		floundering in the face of hurt feelings, emotional withdrawal, escalating conflict, 
		insufficient coping techniques and just plain boredom.</h4>
	There’s no denying it: making and keeping happy and healthy relationships is hard.
But a growing field of research into relationships is increasingly providing science-based guidance into the habits of the healthiest, happiest couples — and how to make any struggling relationship better.

           “Every couple has differences,” continues Johnson. 
		   “What makes couples unhappy is when they have an emotional disconnection and they can’t get a feeling of secure base or safe haven with this person.”
		   She notes that criticism and rejection — often met with defensiveness and withdrawal — are 
		   exceedingly distressing, and something that our brain interprets as a danger cue. To foster emotional responsiveness between partners, Johnson pioneered Emotionally Focused Therapy, in which couples learn to bond through having conversations that express needs and avoid criticism. “Couples have to learn how to talk about feelings in ways that brings the other person closer,” says Johnson.

        According to Carrie Cole, director of research for the Gottman Institute,
		an organization dedicated to the research of marriage, emotional disengagement 
		can easily happen in any relationship when couples are not doing things that create positivity.
		“When that happens, people feel like they’re just moving further and further apart until they don’t even know each other anymore,”
		says Cole. That focus on positivity is why the Gottman Institute has embraced the motto “small things often.” 
		The Gottman Lab has been studying relationship satisfaction since the 1970s, and that research drives the Institute’s psychologists to encourage couples to engage in small, routine points of contact that demonstrate appreciation.
