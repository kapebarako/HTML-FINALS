    <h1 style="text-align: left; margin-left:30px;">When You Should Take a Mental Health Day</h1>
    <h5 style="text-indent: 30px;">Elizabeth Scott<b> || </b>March 24, 2020</h5>
    <hr class="line3">
    <div class="right"><img src="../IMAGES/MH/mh9.jpg" width="500px" style="margin:0 20px;"></div>
    <h4 p style="text-align: justify; margin:0 60px;"><strong><br>Stress Management</strong></h4>
	<p style="text-align: justify; margin:0 60px;">
		<br><br>
		Everyone has to deal with varying levels of stress. This can be particularly difficult to manage if you also have symptoms of depression or anxiety. When you feel like your stress levels have reached their peak, it might be time to take a quick break to reset.<br><br>
      
        Sometimes taking a mental health<br> day—a day off that's specifically geared toward stress relief and burnout<br> prevention—is the best thing you can do for yourself. While one day might not solve heavy underlying problems that lead to burnout, a mental health day can provide a much-needed break to pause, regroup, and come back with greater levels of energy and a fresh, less-stressed perspective.<br><br>

        According to research conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO), anxiety and depressive disorders cost more than a trillion dollars globally in lost productivity each year.<br><br>

        Whatever stressors you face, these tips can help you take a mental health day and make the most of it.<br><br>
        <div class="right"><img src="../IMAGES/MH/mh9_1.jpg" width="500px" style="margin:0 20px;"></div>
        <h4 style="text-align: justify; margin:0 60px;"><strong><br>Take a Day</strong></h4>
        <p style="text-align: justify; margin:0 60px;">
        <br><br>
        Once you have decided to take a mental health day, the question then becomes "when and how?"<br><br>

		The best way to avoid feeling stressed about taking a day off is to schedule a day off ahead of time, ensuring that you've taken steps to rearrange your workload or find a replacement for the day. However, if you wake up in the morning and just feel that you can't face the stress of the day, this may be a good time to take a mental health day and make the most of it.<br><br>

		The decision of when to take a mental health day really depends on your personal situation. If your employer is supportive and you are comfortable sharing your reasons, feel free to plan a mental health day out in advance. If you don't want to divulge your reasons for taking a day or if your employer is less understanding, don't feel obligated to share.<br><br>

		While there has been a growing movement to destigmatize mental health issues in the workplace, many employers still do not support mental health concerns as a legitimate reason to miss a day of work.<br><br>

		<h4 style="text-align: justify; margin:0 70px;"><strong>What to Expect</strong></h4>
		<p style="text-align: justify; margin:0 70px;">
		Knowing what you can expect to get out of a mental health day is important. It's important to remember that it isn't a day to hide from your problems.<br><br>

		Problems can seem harder to deal with when they seem close, overwhelming, and inescapable. Taking a mental break from work and spending some time on self-care can sometimes give you the mini-break you need to head back into things with a clear head.<br><br>

		<h4 style="text-align: justify; margin:0 70px;"><strong>Decide What You Need Most</strong></h4>
		<p style="text-align: justify; margin:0 70px;">
		Sometimes this one is a no-brainer—if you're exhausted, your body will be screaming that it needs to rest. Of, if you feel you can't face another day of hard work, you may just need to have some fun. However, if you're feeling overwhelmed, you may not be as aware of your needs.<br><br>

		Take a minute and really reflect: Would you benefit the most from some tension relief? Or from making a few changes that will relieve stress in the future? Some time with a loved one? Or just a change of scenery? As different stressors require different responses, different types of mental health days fill unique needs.<br><br>

		<h4 style="text-align: justify; margin:0 70px;"><strong>If You Need to Relax</strong></h4>
		<p style="text-align: justify; margin:0 70px;">
		Taking a mental health day often means taking time out to relax. That can mean watching TV in pajamas for hours, or puttering around the house and doing nothing. As long as this isn't an everyday thing, that's fine. Some activities can take a little front-end effort and feel immensely relaxing once they're completed.<br><br>

	   	<div class="right"><img src="../IMAGES/MH/mh9_2.jpg" width="200px" style="margin:0 60px;"></div>
	   	<p style="text-align: justify; margin:0 70px;">
	   	Some things you can try include:<br><br>
    <ul style="text-align: justify; margin:0 70px;" class="text">
	   	<li>Attending a yoga class

	   	<li>Getting a massage

       	<li>Swimming at the gym

       	<li>Taking a walk in nature</li>
       	<br><br>
    </ul>
       	<h4 style="text-align: justify; margin:0 70px;"><strong>If You Need Some Fun</strong></h4>
       	<p style="text-align: justify; margin:0 70px;">
       	If you really need a change of scenery and a "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" kind of mental health day, be sure you make the most of it. Plan at least one fun event—either something you normally love to do and don't do often enough, or something you've always wanted to try. Take a good friend along, if possible, to really make the day memorable.<br><br>

		If nothing grabs your attention, try to engage in activities that provide just the right type of challenge: Hobbies, games, and the like.<br><br>

		<h4 style="text-align: justify; margin:0 70px;"><strong>If You Need to Make Some Changes</strong></h4>
		<p style="text-align: justify; margin:0 70px;">
		If the stressors seem to pile up and you're looking for a way to slow down and stop the "noise," you may want to take a day to restructure things. You may not be able to eliminate all of your ongoing stressors in a day, but you might be able to make a significant reduction in a few areas, which may, in turn, create a lasting impact on your stress levels.<br><br>

		<h4 style="text-align: justify; margin:0 70px;"><strong>If You Need a Longer Break</strong></h4>
		<p style="text-align: justify; margin:0 70px;">
		If you're concerned that your overall stress levels need more than just a mental health day, consider taking a staycation or vacation. You may also consider whether you're headed toward burnout.<br><br>

		Online resources can also help, and you may want to also bring up your concerns with your doctor, or talk to a mental health professional. There are many steps that can be taken to help.<br><br>

		<h4 style="text-align: justify; margin:0 70px;"><strong>A Word From Verywell</strong></h4>
		<p style="text-align: justify; margin:0 70px;">
		Look for ways to keep stress levels low and so that you don't wake up one morning in dire need of an "emergency mental health day." A mental health day can be useful on occasion, but you should also strive to make your mental health a priority every day.
