        <h4>Human beings like certainty.  We are hard-wired to want to know what is happening when and to notice things that feel threatening to us.</h4>
             When things feel uncertain or when we don’t generally feel safe, it’s normal to feel stressed. This very reaction, while there to protect us, 
			 can cause all sorts of havoc when there is a sense of uncertainty and conflicting information around us.
			 A large part of anxiety comes from a sense of what we think we should be able to control, but can’t.  
			 Right now, many of us are worried about COVID-19, known as the “Coronavirus”.  We may feel helpless 
			 about what will happen or what we can do to prevent further stress.  The uncertainty might also connect 
			 to our uncertainty about other aspects of our lives, or remind us of past times when we didn’t feel safe 
			 and the immediate future was uncertain.

				We can always choose our response. </h5><h1>"</h1>

        In times like these, our mental health can suffer.  We don’t always know it’s happening.  You might feel more on edge than usual, 
		angry, helpless or sad.  You might notice that you are more frustrated with others or want to completely avoid any reminders of 
		what is happening.  For those of us who already struggle with our mental wellness, we might feel more depressed or less motivated 
		to carry out our daily activities.  If you are struggling, here are some things you can do to take care of your mental health in 
		the face of uncertainty: separate what is in your control from what is not, do what helps you feel a sense of safety, get outside in 
		nature--even if you are avoiding crowds, challenge yourself to stay in the present, and stay connected and reach out if you need more support.
