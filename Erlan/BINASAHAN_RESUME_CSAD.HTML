        <p>Dear Company,</p>
        <p>I must admit programming was not my first hobby. but as i grew my love for it grow mre and more thats  why I 
		want to take the next step with in regards of my pro career. I know that I would not be the best of the best
		but I can be sure that I will always be the most hardworker. <q><i>first in, last out</i></q> as they say I would make it to the point
		that I would be the first one to come in to work and be the last one to go out of work, with that mindset I now have the hobby of being a critical thinker 
		I always think of things that I could make better and efficient, and now that I know that being a critical thinker is huge parts of programming, I can use this 
		skill to adapt on my work efficiently.</p>

        <p>One of my hobbies before was playing computer games, until one day my curiosity got the best of me, I always imagined how games work the way they do.
		and with that I always try to look to the directories of the game and understand the programming side of it. At first I can't understand anything but with the help of 
		my education and peers I could understand it bit by bit.</p>

        <p>I would like to be the best version of myself and that will be my goal until my time is up. I belived that all of us has room for improvement
		and with that comes programmin. there will always be a better approach on how we code programs and thats our missiong, the programmers to make our programs more efficient
		I know for sure that this thing doesn't have it's sealing. It will always have it's room for improvement.</p>

        <p>Problem solving is one of my hobbies especially because it's challenging. One of my  dreams is to be an prosecutor, because someday i wanted to be a lawyer, but 
		I think life has a way of placing us on the right track, I have been in a comscie course and into my surprise I was able to use my problem solving skills into my 
		current course. I am surprise that my life has not been the life that I have imagined but the skills that i have gained surely helped me in every way possible that
I could have imagined.</p>

        <p>The surface of programming was complicated to look at first, but with time and practice I am sure that you could adapt and cope up with it's environment 
		I didn't think that I could make it at first because programming really looks complicated and problematic. and then with the help of my friends and teachers I can
		surely say that anyone is capable.</p>

        <p>I would like to thank this administration who accepted my resume and considering to make me a part of the company I woud do my best and make everything in my power 
		to be the best version of myself in anyway possible especially at work.</p>
        <p>Sincerely,</p>
        <p><strong>Binasahan Erlan Klaud G. Binasahan</strong></p>
