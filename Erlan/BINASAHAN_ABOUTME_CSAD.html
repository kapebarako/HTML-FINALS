	<h1 id="Childhood">Childhood Years</h1>
	<div align="justify">
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I considered my childhood days as an adaptive stage in my life.<sup>1</sup>
That is the time where life taught me, that change is constant.<sup>2</sup>My childhood days were full of moving in and out of the city and province.<sup>3</sup>
However that part of my life taught me so many things.<sup>4</sup>My parents were always there to keep me in check and I love that.<sup>5</sup>As my life moves forward, old memories fade away and new ones become an essential part of my life.<sup>6</sup> 
However, if there is one thing that will stay with me forever, it would be my childhood memories.<sup>7</sup> 
My past experiences made me realize one thing,I truly love life, I love it with all my heart,
and I keep saying to others that whatever circumstances we as people have to go through, life is still worth living.<sup>8</sup>
As a kid I always cheered up on everyone that is around me.<sup>9</sup> 
That is one of the lessons that my parents have given to me, be hopeful and trust <strong>God</strong>.<sup>10</sup>I would always put my trust in him no matter what.<sup>11</sup>
I wanna live my life with the best, and that is with <strong>God.</strong><sup>12</sup>As a kid I grew up in a christian family.<sup>13</sup>
We would always go to church every sunday and all of us were workers<sup>14</sup>My childhood memories are so fun but there's something in me that asks my self eveytime<sup>15</sup>
Everyone has a few memories from their childhood that seem so vividly true that we cling onto them and believe that every single little detail of this memory is completely true<sup>16</sup>
What if someone told you that parts of this memory could be entirely false, even the whole memory could be fabricated?<sup>17</sup>
How do you determine if this memory is actual something that you went through, or if it was a story that you fabricated a “movie” for in your head?<sup>18</sup>
As a kid we like to think of things that never happened in the first place<sup>19</sup>
Thats why i wanna relive my memories, the memories that really happened and shape me to become the man that I am today.<sup>20</sup></p>

<h1 id="Teenage">Teenage Years</h1>
<div align ="justify">
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a stage of awakening for me, one of the hardest but still one of the best.<sup>1</sup>
It was far from perfect, but it was the perfect experience that I needed to grow.<sup>2</sup>This is a wakeup call for me honestly,6 years ago we move in Paranaque
and that was a big adjustment for me especially we've live in laguna province.<sup>3</sup>This is the time where puppy love is common.<sup>4</sup>
having a puppy love on highschool was one of the best parts of my teenage year, but if i am being honest i didn't thing it was the best at that time.<sup>5</sup>
a lot of thing didn't go my way especially with teeange love, but looking back I can appreciate all of the things that happened to me.<sup>6</sup>Truth be told 
I thought my life was not complete without girls, thats how immature I am from that time.<sup>7</sup>That time I thought having a girl would make my life so good.
<sup>8</sup>I just laugh when I remember this litte part of my life, no one told me before that life was so much than love life.<sup>9</sup>I still remember the things
that my parents always told me before <q>You're young enjoy your life</q>They always told me that.<sup>10</sup>And honestly I'm so glad that they told me things
like that.<sup>11</sup>Life was so much better with our parents, they would be there when we need a helping hand, always.<sup>12</sup>Thats why I am so thankful to them
I wanna grow old to make my life better for them, thats what they want for me, to have a better life.<sup>13</sup>I wanna show them that they didn't fail
at guiding me and my siblings, They are the best!<sup>14</sup>Those are the thing that teenage life made me realize, to be thankful and to live in the momment.<sup>15</sup>
My parents told me that my highschool days will be the best days of my life, and looking back I've realized, that is true.<sup>16</sup>Teenage life is so carefree,
you have the energy, the time and the support of your parents to live how you wanna live.<sup>17</sup>If I'm gonna give my advice to young people whose on highschool
It will always be this <q>Do what you want oppurtunities is not always there</q><sup>18</sup>The thing that I regret the most is the things that I didn't try
not about the things that I did.<sup>19</sup>From now on I would always listen to my heart and consult my brain, I want my brain and heart to work together for me 
to be able to make the best out of my life.<sup>20</sup></p>

<h1 id="College">College Years</h1>
<div align ="justify">
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;College years will always be one of the challenging part of my life.<sup>1</sup>I had an anxiety because 
School year is coming and I still don't have a school to settle down then i decided to go in ubelt where most of the universities are located.<sup>2</sup>
I've come to several schools but I ended up on UE becuase of my neighbor who also studies in UE.<sup>3</sup>At the first day i was anxious on how well can I
perform with the class because my classmates are intimidating, they look and talk like they are one of the top students in there school.<sup>4</sup>
Now I think I have adjusted quite nice with my classmates with the set of right people to motivate you thru the semester.<sup>5</sup>I can say that my experience
in UE was a roller coaster ride, I have a prof whose so terror and scary, I wont mention any names HAHAHHA!<sup>6</sup>But at the end of the day I will do my 
best to conquer the challenges of this university,time flies so fast Im on my 2nd year 2nd sem already.<sup>7</sup>I may not know what's ahead of me but I know 
that God will guide me along the wa.<sup>8</sup>Going back to school is a big decision. You're aware of the benefits of earning a degree, but you're hesitant about the road to graduation.<sup>9</sup>
How will you squeeze classes, assignments and studying into your already busy life? Do you have what it takes to succeed in the classroom?<sup>10</sup>
This are one of the questions that you will ask yourself when you're in a university.<sup>11</sup> It's normal to be apprehensive.<sup>12</sup> But don't let your doubts stand in between you and your dreams.<sup>13</sup>
Navigating college life while fresh out of high school can be a challenge, especially at a large university.<sup>14</sup>Entering college life is what I’m afraid most. Why? It’s because of the great adjustment I’m going to make.<sup>15</sup>
New environment, new classmates, new friends, new teachers/instructors and a new life. It is far from being just a typical high school student.<sup>16</sup>
College life, they say, is <strong>HARD</strong>. They say you would get used to sleeping at midnight or even at dawn just because of the works that you need to finish.<sup>17</sup>
Choosing your course in college has always been one of the most important and wisest decisions that you have to decide because you have to choose the best course that does not only matches your interest because you have to choose the best because your Future depends on it…<sup>18</sup>'
first days in college are always a hassle. You’ve got to prepare yourself either for the best or worst. This has always been a mindset for many students like me.<sup>19</sup>
I miss those days of college, I think online class has its own pros and cons I hope that our country will soon rise from this pandemic I wish all of us a Gooluck, Godbless<sup>20</sup></p>
