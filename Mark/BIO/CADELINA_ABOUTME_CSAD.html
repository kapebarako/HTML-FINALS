	<blockquote><h4>Fragments of Nostalgia</h4></blockquote>

	<blockquote><p style="color:cyan;"><sup>[1]</sup>Some of my best memories I had from my childhood are the ones I had with my younger brother.<sup>[2]</sup>One of which was the time I taught him how to ride properly a bicycle.<sup>[3]</sup>Another time was when my family and I took a trip to Universal Studios <dfn>Singapore</dfn> whilst I was having a holiday there in <dfn>Singapore</dfn>.<sup>[4]</sup>Thirdly, the time we went to Dream World in Thailand when we both were little kids.<BR><BR>
	<sup>[5]</sup>Firstly, this was back in 2009 in <dn>Singapore</dn> — I just entered secondary school whilst he was still in primary school — my younger brother wanted to ride a bicycle without training wheels due to not having own one yet. <sup>[6]</sup>So I lent him my bicycle and we brought it down our apartment building where we lived.<sup>[7]</sup>As I watched him try to ride the bike, I noticed that he was wobbling when he turned.<sup>[8]</sup> This meant that he had not learnt how to turn properly. And so I taught him to ride it around the pillar of the building.<sup>[9]</sup>He did it several times until he got the hang of it.<BR><BR>
	<sup>[10]</sup>Secondly, after coming here in the <dfn>Philippines</dfn> to continue my secondary schooling, I took a vacation in <dfn>Singapore</dfn> and just a few days before leaving for the <dfn>Philippines</dfn>, we decided to make a trip to Universal Studios.<sup>[11]</sup>I remembered we rode the extreme roller coaster which was too thrilling for all of us. We rode pretty much every ride we could ride and even watched a musical that featured mainly rock music which I adore.<sup>[12]</sup>Moreover, my brother bought a souvenir, which he then gave to me.<BR><BR>
	<sup>[13]</sup>Lastly, this memory I had of us was long ago when I was around nine years old and he was around 3 years old.<sup>[14]</sup>Similar to Universal Studios, Dream World is an amusement park, however the difference is that Dream World is more like a photo-oriented and sight-seeing amusement park rather than oriented to exciting rides.<sup>[15]</sup> And so there were not any roller coasters nor whatnot —- instead, our mom took photos of us standing or sitting on bizarre-looking statues that were made to get people pose with them.<sup>[16]</sup>A photo that I distinctively remember was this big wooden chair as if it were made for giants.<sup>[17]</sup>We both sat on it as if we were Jack from Jack In The Beanstalk story when we invaded the giants’ territory.<sup>[18]</sup>That insightful memories that i would never forget.<sup>[19]</sup>As time goes, feels like it was just yesterday.<sup>[20]</sup>In conclusion, these are the memorable memories I distinctively recall from my childhood with my younger brother.</p></blockquote>

	<blockquote><p style="color: cyan;"><sup>[1]</sup>When I think back on my adolescence years, a few memories sprang into mind. Although they may be a few of them, those few are actually insofar memorable.<sup>[2]</sup> Although they may be a few of them, those few are actually insofar memorable.<BR><BR>

	<sup>[3]</sup>After not seeing my brother for a year, I had a holiday to <dfn>Singapore</dfn> for several weeks near the end of 2016 to the beginning or midst of 2017.<sup>[4]</sup>At that time my older sister, who is the eldest amongst us siblings, had her holiday too from Germany accompanied with her boyfriend.<sup>[5]</sup>One day, my sister decided that we should all — my family and her boyfriend — go and visit the park near Marina Bay Sands to see the Christmas display that was showing.<sup>[6]</sup>Whilst we were there, my mom took photos of us in front of a enormous statue of a naked baby.<sup>[7]</sup>Soon after that, my older sister and younger brother went to try to ice skate as they had an ice skating rink built in the park whilst my sister’s boyfriend and I talked in the rain as we wait for them to finish ice skating.<sup>[8]</sup>Afterwards when they were done, we went to see a light show.<sup>[9]</sup> In addition, my sister bought herself a Christmas hat.<sup>[10]</sup>At night, my brother bought himself a Chocolate smoothie with marshmallows from Coffee Bean, which he adores.<sup>[11]</sup> This night made me happy for we had a good time.><BR><BR>

	<sup>[12]</sup>Another memorable memory was the time we went to Tagaytay.<sup>[13]</sup>We rode this ride called The Viking wherein a ship swings back and forth like a pendulum.<sup>[14]</sup>After riding it, he and I were very dizzy.<sup>[15]</sup>My brother even gestured to stop the ride.<sup>[16]</sup>At night, we rode this ride called Flying Fox wherein one rides with a harness from a point to another point — all while sliding from a very high area.<sup>[17]</sup>We had our photos taken afterwards.<sup>[18]</sup>It was very enjoyable for I could see the Taal volcano and the ghastly jungle below me.<BR><BR>

	<sup>[19]</sup>In a nutshell, although there are a few memories I had of my teenage years, these are the ones I most remember of.<sup>[20]</sup> When I look back on these now, I feel that these were one of my happier moments in life, not only of my adolescence.<sup>[21]</sup>And maybe I could even share these memories to my future children one day.</blockquote>

	<blockquote><p style="color: cyan;"><sup>[1]</sup>Right before I entered college, my family and I went to my mother’s hometown province of Quezon.<sup>[2]</sup>We stayed there for a week or so. During the journey towards our destination,I listened to music on my phone whilst the rest were sleeping, especially my mother and grandma.
	<sup>[3]</sup>It took us for about a day to get there.<sup>[4]</sup>When we arrived to the province, I guess it was already night time.<sup>[5]</sup>The sunset casted an azure colour across the sky as if the evening twilight wanted us to finally rest for the night.<BR><BR>

	<sup>[6]</sup>The next morning we went to the nearby beach and lounged in the sands before heading back for lunch.<sup>[7]</sup>At lunch, we had a variety of food on the table, but I only managed to ate a few whilst my brother ate quite a lot.<sup>[8]</sup> In the days of residing there, we went to the beach, relaxed on a hammock, visited some shops that sold souvenirs and gifts and bought locally farmed fruits that my mother could not buy anywhere else but in the province.<sup>[9]</sup>We visited the beach a few times. I swam in it along with my brother, parents and cousin.<sup>[10]</sup>We also hopped into a boat and cruised around the place as we had a tour instructor showing us faraway hill mountains and islands.<sup>[11]</sup>If I remember correctly, the last day was rather an emotional experience for I would miss its peacefulness and serenity the province offered, considering it being a countryside.<sup>[12]</sup>And the absence of buildings made me appreciate the countryside more.<BR><BR>

	<sup>[13]</sup>The ambience of the places is beautiful.<sup>[14]</sup>The next day, we went to Baler.<sup>[15]</sup>We did not managed to explore the places because we have to go home as soon as possible.<sup>[16]</sup><sup>[17]</sup>But we still mangaged to enjoy for a moment.<sup>[18]</sup>It was very enjoyable.<sup>[19]</sup>Overall, its a good vacation trip a had before my college years<sup>[20]</sup>I'm hoping to visit it again.<blockquote></blockquote>
