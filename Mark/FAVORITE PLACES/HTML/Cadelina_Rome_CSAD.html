<blockquote><p align="center" style="color: black; background-color: white;font-size:25px;">ABOUT ROME, ITALY<br><br>
Rome, historic city and capital of Roma provincia (province), of Lazio regione (region), and of the country of Italy. Rome is located in the central portion of the Italian peninsula, on the Tiber River about 15 miles (24 km) inland from the Tyrrhenian Sea. Once the capital of an ancient republic and empire whose armies and polity defined the Western world in antiquity and left seemingly indelible imprints thereafter, the spiritual and physical seat of the Roman Catholic Church, and the site of major pinnacles of artistic and intellectual achievement, Rome is the Eternal City, remaining today a political capital, a religious centre, and a memorial to the creative imagination of the past.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p align="center" style="color:black; background-color: white; font-size:25px;">DIRECTIONS TO ITALY<br><br>
If you are flying to Rome, you should know there are two airports in Rome: Fiumicino (Leonardo da Vinci) and Ciampino. Fiumicino airport is the main Rome international airport. Ciampino used to be a military airport, and in recent years it has become a hub for many of the low-cost airlines that fly to Rome.</blockquote>
