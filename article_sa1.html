    <h1 style="text-align: left; margin-left:30px;">The Importance of Self-awareness</h1>

    <div class="center" style="text-align:justify; margin:0 50px;">
        <h4>Think about describing yourself</h4> to another person without mentioning any external 
            factors such as  friends or family. Concentrate solely on yourself, how you feel and behave, 
            what your strengths and weakenesses are, what make you angry or what makes you happy.<br><br>
            This exercise is about finding out how self-aware we are as individuals. Self-awareness 
            (sometimes also referred to as self-knowledge or introspection) is about understanding your 
            own needs, desires, failings, habits, and everything else that makes you the unique individual 
            that you are. The more you know about yourself, the better you are at adapting to life's changes. 
            When we have a better understanding of ourselves, we are able to experience ourselves as unique and 
            separate individuals. This empowers us to make changes and build on our areas of strength, as well as 
            identify areas where we would like to make improvements. Self-awareness is often the first step to 
            setting goals.

                <h1>"</h1><h5 style="text-align: center;">Research shows that self-awareness is directly related to both emotional 
                    intelligence and success.</h5><h1>"</h1>

            Self-awareness helps you create achievable goals because you can consider your strengths, weaknesses, and what 
            drives you when you are setting goals. It allows you to guide yourself down the right path by choosing 
            to pursue the opportunities that best fit your skillset, preferences and tendencies. It makes it easier 
            to identify situations and people that hit our triggers and enables us to anticipate our own reactions. 
            It allows us to make positive behavioral changes that can lead to greater personal and interpersonal success.
            Self-knowledge is also considered an important quality for a mental helath professional. Mental health professionals 
            deal with people from varied cultures, religions, languages, lifestyles, and value systems. In order to counsel effectively, 
            a therapist must recognize his own value systems to be able to respect individuality. Good mental health practitioners will 
            employ intervention beyond learned knowledge or acquired skills, by including themselves in their counseling practice, a task not 
            easily accomplished.

        <h4>Being aware of yourself also helps in identifying what your stressors are, so you can utilize the information to build effective coping mecahnisms. </h4><br>
        <p>Every form of psychotherapy has methods to enhance awareness. Modern psychotherapy began with psychoanalysis, the talk therapy 
        originated by Sigmund Freud. Psychoanalysis employs free association to help people become aware of the thoughts and memories 
        constantly emerging in a stream of consciousness. Psychoanalysts also interpret dreams to enhance awareness of the emotional context of 
        experience that may otherwise escape observation.</p>
        <p>The current wave of cognitive therapies teach secular versions of Buddhist mindfulness practices. Enhanced mindfulness helps 
        people increasingly act in accord with their values, instead of reacting with escape and avoidance behaviors that typically make 
        problems worse.</p>
        <hr class="line2">
        <h4 style="text-align: center;">Being self-aware helps not just build a strong therapeutic relationship, but also helps a lay person make more imformed decisions, 
            and contributes to one's overall wellbeing.</h4>
