        <h4>Love has been defined in various ways.</h4>
        From a deep feeling of affection, to the embodiment of virtues that always protects, 
        trusts, hopes, and perseveres. And for centuries, humans have found ways to celebrate 
        the existence of love. <br>
        Now, with a better understanding of the biology and chemistry of love, science has 
        begun to recognize that there are health benefits as well. Helping our patients understand 
        the value and importance of maintain loving relationships may help them to benefit from love’s 
        positive effects on mental health.

            <hr class="line2">
        </div>

        <div class="two" style="text-align:justify;">
            Science now provides us evidence that what is experienced when we are involved in loving relationships 
            involve various neurotransmitters and hormones in our bodies that affect us systemically. In the book 
            A General Theory of Love (2001), a trio of psychiatry professors, Thomas Lewis, MD, Fari Amini, MD and 
            Richard Lannon, MD, describe it in the following way: “Our nervous systems are not separate or 
            self-contained; beginning in earliest childhood, the areas of our brain identified as the limbic system 
            (hippocampus, amygdala, anterior thalamic nuclei, and limbic cortex) is affected by those closest to us 
            (limbic resonance) and synchronizes with them (limbic regulation) in a way that has profound implications 
            for personality and lifelong emotional health.” <br><br>
            <h5>Interestingly, we can actually see evidence of these connections when we explore research in this area 
                related to stress management, depression, anxiety. </h5>  
        </div>

    <div class="center" style="text-align:justify; margin:0 50px;">
        <p>Depression and anxiety disorders are the most common mental health disorders in the United States, and social 
        isolation is clearly linked to higher rates of depression and anxiety. According to a Health and Human Services 
        report, getting married and staying married reduces depression in both men and women. And research in the areas of 
        physical health has shown that high levels of social support may actually improve prognosis in such conditions as 
        cancer and myocardial infarctions by reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression that can often be associated with 
        these illnesses.</p><br>
        <div class="left"><img src="images/r2_2.jpg" width="500px" style="margin:0 20px;"></div>
        <p>Accordingly, treatment of depression often times includes focusing on interpersonal relationships as a way to 
        improve depression as is the case in attachment therapy in children and interpersonal therapy in adults. In addition, 
        Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT), which focuses on transforming relationships into ones that feels safe, secure and 
        connected, have also been found to be effective in significantly reducing the symptoms of depression and anxiety. 
        Ultimately, encouraging our patients to be involved in loving and stable supportive relationships can potentially help 
        in their recovery from common mental health illnesses.</p>
        <p>Mahatma Ghandi once wrote, “Where there is love there is life.” Loving and stable relationships can help to improve 
            a person’s ability to manage stress and can help to decrease anxiety and depression. We are all social creatures. 
            Therefore, as were provide mental health treatment, let us be mindful to evaluate our patient’s level of social 
            connectedness, and always encourage them to develop and nurture stable and loving relationships. </p>
