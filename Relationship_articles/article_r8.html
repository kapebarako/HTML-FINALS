        <h4>One of the many relationships people will run into throughout their lives is the relationship they have with themselves.</h4>
        “Your relationship with yourself is arguably the most important relationship in life,” said Grant Brenner, a psychiatrist, in a 
		post on the Psychology Today website.<br>
		David Wahl, research associate for Iowa State, said this type of relationship between an individual and their self comes down
		to cultivating awareness. He said when someone cultivates awareness of their self they are able to motivate themselves toward 
		goals that are meaningful to the individual and that awareness also aids in healthier and more beneficial decisions and behaviors 
		for the individual.

                <h1>"</h1><h5 style="text-align: center;">Self-relationship is the foundation of everything else.</h5><h1>"</h1>
            <hr class="line2">
        </div>

        <div class="two" style="text-align:justify;">
            Wahl said the relationship people have with their self is continually 
			developing. He said throughout a person’s life they must recognize the changes 
			and respond to them. Some of these changes occur internally, while other changes 
			are imposed by a person’s social environment. Wahl said the individual must maintain 
			awareness of the ongoing changes and acknowledge and respond accordingly. <br>
			“Early in development, relationships with others shape the relationship with 
			oneself,” Brenner said. “There are intrinsic tendencies about the relationship 
			with oneself as well. As we grow up, the way we are treated by others, and the 
			way those others deal with themselves, serve as important factors influencing 
			how we address ourselves as adults.”<br>

        <p>Though there can be bad side effects when someone does not take care of themselves, there 
		are steps people can take to improve their relationship with themself.</h5>
		<h5>Setting the goal</h5>
		<p>Anytime a person starts a project, it is important to have a goal in mind. Creating a healthy
		relationship with yourself is not a small project and may take years, according to Brenner. Set 
		the overarching goal, over a span of years, to keep moving toward a good relationship with yourself, 
		with the understanding that what this entails will change over the years, Brenner said in his article 
		on the Psychology Today website.</p>
		<h5>Prioritize basic self-care</h5>
		<p>Starting and continuing any relationship begins with kindness and the relationship someone has with 
		oneself is no different. “This doesn't mean 'letting yourself off the hook' or shirking responsibility, but it does mean 
		working toward appraising yourself without destructively aggressive criticism or blame,” Brenner said.
		“People are often blame-dependent regarding self-appraisal and self-correction, and more often than not,
		excessive blaming leads to less effective change.”</p>
		<h5>Establish good habits</h5>
		<p>Another good thing to start that will help with maintaining a healthy relationship with oneself is getting into good habits.
		<br>“Start your day in such a way that you increase the likelihood of having a day that supports your self-relationship goals,” 
		Brenner said. “Some people find it useful to write down daily goals the night before and review them first thing in the morning. 
		Others hold these ideas in mind and can review them mentally.”</p>
		<br>
        <div class="left"><img src="../images/r8_2.jpg" width="500px" style="margin:0 20px;"></div>
        <p>Brenner said it is important to remind yourself of your long-term intentions and goals, review key practices you want for 
		that specific day and rehearse how you want to address problematic activities in your day shortly after waking up.<br>
		Other good habits could be to regularly make time for yourself. Sit quietly for 10 minutes in the morning with your first 
		cup of coffee or find books that speak to you and steal moments to dig into them every day.</p>
