        <h4>Increasing evidence gests that significantly greater barriers exist to receipt of mental health 
            care in comparison with physical health care.</h4>
            Worldwide, more than 70% of young people and adults with mental illness do not receive any mental 
            health treatment from health care staff. The difference between true prevalence and treated prevalence 
            can be called the treatment This article describes the roles that stigma and discrimination 
            contribute to the treatment  and assesses the evidence that public health approaches to stigma 
            and discrimination can facilitate access to mental health care. We present new data from the evaluation 
            of Time to Change, Englandâ€™s largest ever program to reduce mental illness stigma and discrimination.

            Evidence suggests that factors increasing the likelihood of treatment avoidance 
            or delay before presenting for care include (1) lack of knowledge to identify features 
            of mental illnesses, (2) ignorance about how to access treatment, (3) prejudice against 
            people who have mental illness, and (4) expectation of discrimination against people diagnosed
            with mental illness. Stigma and discrimination and their influence on access to care may vary based 
            on experience of mental distress or other sociodemographic factors. For instance, psychotic disorders 
            are highly stigmatizing, and people with psychosis are more likely to be perceived as violent and 
            unpredictable relative to people with other mental health problems.

        Addressing public stigma might reduce experienced and anticipated stigma among services users and 
        facilitate help seeking and engagement with mental health care. For example, individual service users 
        living in countries with higher rates of help seeking and treatment utilization, in addition to better 
        perceived access to information about how to deal with mental health problems and less stigmatizing 
        attitudes, tended to have lower rates of self-stigma and perceived discrimination. Globally, however, 
        stigmatizing attitudes persist among the public and have been shown to be prevalent and associated 
        with a reluctance to seek help. Specifically, beliefs about effectiveness of treatment and services 
        at the start of treatment have been shown to influence subsequent treatment behavior. This is 
        significant because currently individuals often only access services once they have already experienced 
        significant impairment, clinical symptoms, and stigma, and these effects may be difficult to reverse.
