    <blockquote><h3 id="child">* Childhood...</h3></blockquote>
    <div>
        <blockquote><p>
        My life had started when I was born at precisely <b>2:12 AM on January 7, 2001</b>.<sup>1</sup> I was born into a strict household, with my grandmother taking care of me and my big sister while my parents were gone for work.<sup>2</sup> My prominent childhood memory was my grandmother teaching me much about discipline and so I must thank her for my strong foundation of self-control and responsibility.<sup>3</sup> 
        </p>
        <p>Aside from my strict household, most of my time as a kid was spent watching cartoons and <i>anime</i>.<sup>4</sup> These fictional shows are what urged me to learn how to draw and I think, no matter how many times I’ve regretted drawing instead of studying, I can truly say that I’m glad I learned how to draw.<sup>5</sup> Drawing has been my outlet to express myself better especially in a household where rules were prioritized more than emotion.<sup>6</sup> 
        <b>Drawing</b> has humanized me and has helped me cope with most parts of my life.<sup>7</sup> In a sense, fantasy has been my means of escape.<sup>8</sup> 
        </p>
        <p>It was due to my detachment from reality, however, that I felt different from the rest of the pack.<sup>9</sup> In my prep years, I didn’t have friends.<sup>10</sup> I didn’t know how to interact with anyone and it was just awkward overall.<sup>11</sup> It was like I didn’t belong and sometimes I think maybe that was why I was bullied.<sup>12</sup> 
        Another prominent memory from my childhood was all the bullying I experienced.<sup>13</sup> Unfortunately, childhood was not the only phase I've experienced bullying but I shall focus on my first experience with being bullied in this section.<sup>14</sup> At first, I didn't understand why.<sup>15</sup> I remember that feeling of culture shock.<sup>16</sup> 
        I thought I'd have a group of friends with whom I share my interests with like those plotlines I see in cartoons.<sup>17</sup> At that moment I realized that making friends is not that easy.<sup>18</sup> 
        </p>
        <p>My experience with bullying was <em>most definitely not pleasant</em>.<sup>19</sup> The indifference I felt marked something in my brain that I must always do my best to fit in.<sup>20</sup> However, it didn't work that well after prep.<sup>21</sup> Grade school was not that different-- the bullying did subside but I still felt the indifference and in turn, I was hostile to everyone else.<sup>22</sup> 
        It was at that time as well that I thought maybe it's better to just retreat back to my safe space-- the fantasies I build inside my head.<sup>23</sup>

    <div>
        <blockquote><p>
        People often think about <i>"teenage rebellion"</i> when they remember their teens.<sup>1</sup> Teenage years are the epitome of self-discovery.<sup>2</sup> We find ourselves reigning on an identity that we best find ourselves in.<sup>3</sup> In my case, unfortunately <small>(once again)</small>, it was <em>"teenage depression"</em>.<sup>4</sup> I felt empty in my teenage years.<sup>5</sup> I didn't know how I was supposed to talk, eat, act-- <i>be</i>.<sup>6</sup> 
        I had friends now who shared some of my interests and it made me happy but I still felt <b>empty</b>.<sup>7</sup> It was the time that I think it was best for me to disappear.<sup>8</sup> Retreating to my fantasies backfired as I lost hold of reality.<sup>9</sup> My grades were dropping and my parents told me if this keeps up they'll have to remove me from school.<sup>10</sup> At that point, I realized as well that I did not have dreams and aspirations in life and so I thought <em>maybe it was time to have one.</em><sup>11</sup> 
        </p>
        <p>It was at the start of my high school years that I've decided to dedicate my time to studying.<sup>12</sup> It was when I realized that when you're smart, people will talk to you.<sup>13</sup> People would like to hear your thoughts and reason out with you because you are credible; you have the reputation of having good ideas.<sup>14</sup> It was how I got to talk to more people-- they ask for my help and I deliver.<sup>16</sup> I felt relevant for once in my life and it felt <strong>great.</strong><sup>17</sup> 
        I was recognized by my teachers and even represented my school as they made me enter competitions.<sup>18</sup> I was also better with handling my friends now as I gained more confidence to talk.<sup>19</sup> I was good with science and so I thought maybe I wanted to be a chemist.<sup>20</sup> Creating things has always been a worthy task that I'd love to dedicate myself to.<sup>21</sup> The chemicals formed within and after a chemical reaction is what enticed me to this field of science.<sup>22</sup> 
        I saw chemistry as art and it gave me this connection between my dreams and my coping mechanism-- <em>it gave me a reason to exist.</em><sup>23</sup>

        It's a weird thought that I'm currently writing an HTML code for this website as well as the fact that I am enrolled in a Computer Science course.<sup>1</sup> <ins>I can only say, life is weird.</ins><sup>2</sup> Applying for a college while having a financial problem is not a good combination.<sup>3</sup> I was only given the choice between the <i>University of the Philippines</i> or the <i>University of the East</i>.<sup>4</sup> Obviously, I failed <abbr title="University of the Philippines">UP</abbr> and so I am here in <abbr title="University of the East">UE</abbr> thankfully with a scholarship that has enabled me to keep on studying.<sup>5</sup> 
        It was depressing, to say the least.<sup>6</sup> I am ever grateful for a close friend of mine that made sure I was holding my ground and not a rope or a knife.<sup>7</sup> I didn't handle the college rejection well, I thought I was capable enough to be in a school like <abbr title="University of the Philippines">UP</abbr>.<sup>8</sup>
        </p>
        <p>I had no choice but to move on.<sup>9</sup> It was only a matter of circumstance why I ended up in this course.<sup>10</sup> I heard they were offering a scholarship in this course and so I had no choice but to be in a course I had no prior knowledge of.<sup>11</sup> 
        </p>
        <p>My first year in college was unexpectedly great.<sup>12</sup> I struggled a lot with keeping up since most of my classmates came into this course knowing what it would be like.<sup>13</sup> I had to verse myself with programming knowledge and watched lots of tutorials online to help me catch up.<sup>14</sup> 
        Another thing that came to me as a surprise was when I joined the <abbr title="Research and Development">RnD</abbr> unit which exposed me to the <i>vast world of computer science</i>.<sup>15</sup> I did not expect myself to be active in the first year of a course I did not sign up for.<sup>16</sup> Aside from the positive things, however, it was also the time when my mom got hospitalized and was diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer.<sup>17</sup> It was then that I urged myself to work harder in maintaining my scholarship.<sup>18</sup>
        </p>
        <p>First-year was fun overall, I’d say I did find it hard to socialize with others especially with men having been in an all-girls school all my life.<sup>18</sup> Second-year, however, still a work in progress but so far <strong>I’m not so sure if the online setup is ideal for me.</strong><sup>19</sup> It may be a tough year so far,<del> with lots of mental breakdowns and existential crises </del>, but I do believe I can work it out.<sup>20</sup> I’ve gone through a lot and I know that I am still capable in a way and that one day I may finally learn how to love this course.<sup>21</sup>
