        <h3>Verona, Italy</h3>

        <h4>About</h4>
        <img src="pictures/places/ver1.png" width=500px class="left">
        <p>Verona is a city in northern Italy’s Veneto region, with a medieval old town built between the meandering Adige River. 
            It’s famous for being the setting of Shakespeare’s "Romeo and Juliet." A 14th-century residence with a tiny balcony 
            overlooking a courtyard is said be “Juliet’s House." The Verona Arena is a huge 1st-century Roman amphitheater, 
            which currently hosts concerts and large-scale opera performances
          </p>

          <h4>How to get there</h4>
          <img src="pictures/places/ver2.png" width=500px class="right">
          <p>Fly into Verona. Verona's airport is about 7 miles from the city center. Travelers can take a bus or taxi 
              from the airport into town. As of early 2011, no direct flights operate between the United States and Verona; 
              however, the airport accepts numerous European and domestic flights. Likely connection cities include 
              Milan, Rome, Frankfurt or Paris. Ride the train. The Italian railway operates a high-speed line between 
              Milan and Venice, with stops in major cities such as Verona. Regional trains also stop in the Verona train 
              station, as does a Rome-bound train. Milan and Venice are about an hour and a half away by train; 
              Rome is five to seven hours away.

              <figcaption>This huge amphitheater, the largest of its kind ever built by the Roman Empire and the largest of their constructions 
                to survive, remained a model for sports facilities right up to modern times. Built by Vespasian in AD 72 and enlarged by the addition of a fourth story by his son, Titus, 
                it was a venue for public spectacles and shows - even mock sea battles.</figcaption>
