              <figcaption>The town has successfully managed to preserve the historic district where you can still find calesas 
                (horse-drawn carriages). Sample the famous and delicious Ilocos empanada, and walk along cobbled streets 
                lined up with souvenir shops selling pottery and Abel Iloko weaves, among the many things to see and do when 
                in Vigan.</figcaption>

          <p id="title">Mayon Volcano, Legazpi</p>
          <figure>
            <img src="pictures/places/mayon.jpg" height=350px>
              <figcaption>Its sheer beauty (the name Mayon comes from the Bicolano word ‘magayon,’ which means beautiful) hides a violent core, with past eruptions that flattened several towns.

                It is already a wonderful experience seeing the volcano from afar. But if you are an adrenaline junkie, you can soak up all its beauty while gliding through a zipline 
                in Lignon Hill. Visit the Cagsawa Ruins for another unique and historic viewing point of the Mayon Volcano.</figcaption>
