      <h4>About</h4>
      <img src="pictures/places/gre1.png" width=500px class="left">
      <p>Perched above present-day Athens, the Acropolis draws you up and in. Follow in the footsteps of ancients 
          as you walk up the same steps that have been walked on since 438 BC - 2,500 years.
          Views out over the city are incredible as you walk between the meticulously restored ancient buildings. 
          Near the end of the day, you'll want to linger and watch the sunset from the stairs near the entrance. 
          This is a nightly ritual in Athens.The site is also impressive looking up at it from the city below. 
          Spend an evening dining on a rooftop patio to soak in the view of the hilltop ruins lit up at night.
        </p>
        <h4>How to get there</h4>
        <img src="pictures/places/gre2.png" height=300px class="right">
        <p>The approximate time from the Athens International Airport to the Hotel is 1 hour. You will board 
            the Metro from the Airport’s Station (blue line) and get off at Syntagma Station. 
            At Syntagma Station you switch lines in the direction of Elliniko (red line) and get off at Station, 
            “Syngrou-Fix” or “Acropolis”. To access the hotel on foot, take the metro to “Acropolis” station.
            Ascend Dionysiou Areopagitou pedestrian street and then turn left on Garibaldi street which leads 
            to Mousson street. A closer station but more steep to walk is the Syngrou-Fix metro station. When 
            you get off at this station, take the exit “Drakou Street” and walk up towards Filopappou Hill. You 
            will find Mousson Street right in front of you. You then need to turn left and the hotel is located 
            on your left hand side.

        <figcaption>Adjacent to the Ancient Agora is the site of the Roman Agora. While it may all seem like one site, these buildings 
            were constructed later, and construction eventually moved on to the site of the Ancient Agora.</figcaption>
