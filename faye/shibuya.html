        <h4>About</h4>
        <img src="pictures/places/shi1.png" width=400px class="left">
        <p>Shibuya Crossing is one of Tokyo's most recognizable sights, pictured in countless films, magazines and 
            blogs. During its busiest times, an estimated 1,000 to 2,500 people forge their way across this 
            intersection every two minutes, enough to quickly fill up a football stadium.
            The phenomenon gave rise to its nickname "scramble," as pedestrians cross from all directions. 
            Shibuya Crossing walks the line between manic chaos and perfect synchronization.

          <h4>How to get there</h4>
          <img src="pictures/places/shi2.png" width=400px class="right">
          <p>Shibuya Crossing is located directly outside Shibuya Station's Hachiko exit.
            Take the major city loop, the JR Yamanote Line, and get off at Shibuya Station. The Keio Inokashira, 
            Tokyu Den-en-toshi and Tokyu Toyoko lines all stop at Shibuya, as do the Tokyo Metro Ginza, Hanzomon 
            and Fukutoshin subway lines.
